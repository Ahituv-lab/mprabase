## Overview

The rapid decline in synthesis and sequencing costs coupled with advances in reporter assay experimentation have enabled to functionally test the regulatory activity of millions of sequences. This is done using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) that can test the regulatory activity of thousands of sequences in parallel by placing them in front of a transcribed barcode or using the assayed sequence as the barcode (STARR-seq).


MPRAbase is a comprehensive, easily accessible database whose goal is to store published MPRA datasets, process them, present them in a user-friendly manner, provide easy to use search tools and rapidly download these datasets. MPRAbase is being continuously updated with results from newly published experiments.

**Schematic illustration of MPRA experiments.** Various MPRA uses are described in the top left. MPRA libraries are usually prepared via oligonucleotide synthesis, genome fragmentation or isolation of nucleosome free or ATAC-seq regions. These sequences are then cloned into an MPRA vector along with a unique barcode, while in STARR-seq, the assayed sequence is used as the barcode. MPRAs are then delivered to the cells either via transfection or viral infection. DNA and RNA are then extracted and the barcodes are sequences and activity scores are provided.

## Data Types

MPRABase offers two distinct means of accessing MPRA data:

- **Standard MPRA**: Browse and visualize standard (lenti-, STARR etc.) MPRA samples and datasets.

- **Synthetic MPRA**: Browse and visualize synthetic library MPRA samples and datasets.

- **Saturation Mutagenesis**: Exploration of saturation mutagenesis data.

For information on how to access these datasets through MPRABase, please use the relevant help pages from the navigation menu at the top of this documentation.
